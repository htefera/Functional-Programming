# Functional Programming Principles In Scala

This is the first course in Functional Programming in Scala specialization.
### Course Objectives

* Understand the principles of functional programming,
* Write purely functional programs by using recursion, pattern matching, and higher-order functions,
* Combine functional programming with objects and classes,
* Design immutable data structures for complex problems
* Reason out about properties of functions,
* Understand generic types for functional programs
*
### Tools, Technologies and Languages
* **Language**-Scala
* **Editor or IDE**-IntelliJ
* **Build tool**-sbt

### [Week 1](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/recfun)

#### Getting Started + Functions & Evaluation

Get up and running with Scala on your computer. Complete an example assignment to familiarize yourself with our unique way of submitting assignments. In this week, we'll learn the difference between functional imperative programming. We step through the basics of Scala; covering expressions, evaluation, conditionals, functions, and recursion

### [Week 2](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/funsets)
#### Higher Order Functions
This week, we will learn about functions as first-class values, and higher order functions. We'll also learn about Scala's syntax and how it's formally defined. Finally, we'll learn about methods, classes, and data abstraction through the design of a data structure for rational number

### [Week 3](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/objsets)
#### Data and Abstraction
This week, we will cover traits, and we'll learn how to organize classes into hierarchies. We'll cover the hierarchy of standard Scala types, and see how to organize classes and traits into packages. Finally, we'll touch upon the different sorts of polymorphism in Scala

# [Week 4](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/patmat)
#### Types and Pattern Matching
This week we'll learn about the relationship between functions and objects in Scala; functions are objects! We'll zoom in on Scala's type system, covering subtyping and generics, and moving on to more advanced aspects of Scala's type system like variance. Finally, we'll cover Scala's most widely used data structure, Lists, and one of Scala's most powerful tools, pattern matching.


# Week 5
### Lists
This week we dive into Lists, the most commonly-used data structure in Scala

### [Week 6](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/forcomp)
#### Collections
After a deep-dive into Lists, this week we'll explore other data structures; vectors, maps, ranges, arrays, and more. We'll dive into Scala's powerful and flexible for-comprehensions for querying data

### Program Execution
1. Import as sbt project into IntelliJ
2. Run the project either as main program or using sbt
 Running the program using SBR
 1. First start sbt in the project root directory
 2. Inside the sbt console 
      * Compile the program using the **compile** command
      * Test the program using the **test** command
      * Run the program using the **run** command
