# Functional Programming Principles In Scala

This course is given by Coursera and EPFL University[go to the course]()
### Course Objectives

* Understand the principles of functional programming,
* Write purely functional programs by using recursion, pattern matching, and higher-order functions,
* Combine functional programming with objects and classes,
* Design immutable data structures for complex problems
* Reason out about properties of functions,
* Understand generic types for functional programs
<br>

### Tools, Technologies and Languages
* **Language**-Scala
* **Editor or IDE**-IntelliJ
* **Build tool**-sbt

### [Week 1](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/recfun)

#### Getting Started + Functions & Evaluation
* Basics of Scala; covering expressions, evaluation, conditionals, functions, and recursion
* Tools Setup
* Functions evaluations strategies
* Conditionals and value expressions
* Pass by value and pass by name
* Recursion and tail recursion functions

*  Functional sets
<br>

### [Week 3](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/objsets)
#### Data and Abstraction
* Classes and objects
* CLass hierarchies
* Inheritance and polymorphisim 
* Functions as objects
* Object-oriented set
<br>

### [Week 4](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/patmat)
#### Types and Pattern Matching

* Decomposition and pattern matching
* Lists and Enums
* Subtyping, supertping and Generics
* Variance
* Demonstration of Huffman coding using pattern matching 
<br>

### [Week 5]()
#### Scala Lists

* A closer look at lists
* Tuples and generic methods on lists
* Higher order list functions
* Reduction on lists
<br>


### [Week 6](https://github.com/htefera/Functional-Programming-In-Scala/tree/master/forcomp)
#### Collections
* Exploring various collections in addition to lists
* For expressions
* Maps
* combinatorial search using collections
<br>

### Program Execution
1. Import as sbt project into IntelliJ
2. Run the project Into ways 
  *  Run as a main program 
  *  Run with sbt
 Running the program using SBR
 1. First start sbt in the project root directory
 2. Inside the sbt console 
      * Compile the program using the **compile** command
      * Test the program using the **test** command
      * Run the program using the **run** command
